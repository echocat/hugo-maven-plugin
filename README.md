## Features

1. Ensures a Hugo binary is available in the correct version. If required: It will download and install it.
   
2. Can either build single sites or multiple at once.

3. Generated resources can be used as normal sites (at `/public`) or also directly as resources by Java application (as part of the resulting JAR).

4. Easy to configure.

## Getting started

1. Add the repository to your `pom.xml`:
    ```xml
    <pluginRepositories>
        <pluginRepository>
            <id>github</id>
            <url>https://public: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@maven.pkg.github.com/echocat/hugo-maven-plugin</url>
        </pluginRepository>
    </pluginRepositories>
    ```
    > ‚ÑπÔ∏è We need this strange approach because (with this PAT) because of a [strange behaviour of the GitHub Maven Repositories](https://github.community/t/download-from-github-package-registry-without-authentication/14407/111). Sorry for that. ü§¶

2. Bind the plugin to your build process:
    ```xml
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.echocat.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>hugo-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>LATEST_VERSION</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <!-- Give this execution a name,
                             build might be a good one. -->
                        <id>build</id>
                        <goals>
                            <!-- `build` is the default goal.
                                 See below. -->
                            <goal>build</goal>
                        </goals>
                        <configuration>
                            <!-- Configuration to pick up -->
                            <config>config.toml</config>
                        </configuration>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
            <!-- [...] -->
        </plugins>
        <!-- [...] -->
    </build>
    ```

3. Now you can run `mvn package`

Now you should have all those resources on the one hand inside `target/generated-resources/hugo/...` but also in your resulting JAR and by this available in your classpath at `public/...`.

Please see [demos](demos) for many easy demonstrations how to configure and what the result will be.

## Goals

1. [Generic](#generic) which applies to all goals.
2. [`build`](#build) to build a single hugo site.
3. [`build-multi`](#build-multi) to build multiple hugo sites at once.
